# Board Game Against Minimax
## Description
This is my Introduction to Artifical Intelligence term project. It is a simple board game against an AI player.
For creating AI, I used minimax algorithm with alpha - beta pruning and for GUI used pygame.
You can check the game rules below.

## Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

## Dependencies
The game requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- Pygame

You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Games
To start playing, first navigate into the folder of the game that you want to play. Then run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## The Rules of the Game
The board size is 7*7.
Triangle symbols are the pieces of Player 1 which is the AI-based player. Circle symbols are the pieces of Player 2 which is the human player.
Every player has four pieces, and the game starts with the board configuration, as shown in Figure 1.
When the game starts, Player 1 moves first.

### The Rules of the Moves
The pieces can move in both horizontal and vertical directions. Diagonal moves are not allowed.

### Capturing Pieces
If the player’s single piece or group of pieces are between the wall and the opponent piece, they are captured (Figure 2, Figure 3).

If the player’s single piece or group of pieces are between two opponent pieces, it is captured (Figure 4, Figure 5).
If both player’s pieces are between two opponent pieces, all of these pieces are captured (Figure 6).

## Game End
When both players do not have any pieces: It is Draw. When both players have only a single piece: It is Draw.

When the player has some pieces, but the opponent player does not have any pieces: The player wins.

When the player has no pieces, but the opponent player has some pieces: The player losses.

After 50 moves in total:
If both players have same number of pieces: It is Draw. 

If the player has more pieces: The player wins. Else: The player losses.
